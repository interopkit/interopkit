 * The checks, in order: the form has no `oauth_consumer_key` (an LTI 1.0 to 1.2 launch) and has `id_token` and `state`;
 * `state` names a login that the tool started and has not finished; the browser is the one that logged in (the state cookie, or the platform's storage); the signature, the
 * issuer, the audience, the authorized party and the times (Security Framework section 5.1.3); the `nonce` equals the login's;
 * the LTI claims (LTI 1.3 Core section 5.3, Deep Linking 2.0 section 4.4). The login is then deleted, so a launch completes once.
 *
 * On the client-side storage path the platform's post is answered with a verification page and no launch; the page posts
 * again to the same URL, and that second request completes the launch. The host routes both to this function.
 *
 * LTI 1.0 to 1.2 launches are not supported.
 *
 * @param request - The POST of the platform, or of the verification page.
 * @param options - The registrations and the store of the tool, and its `fetch` and clock.
 * @returns The launch, or the verification page, which the host sends.
 * @throws `DataError` when the request is not a POST of a form with `id_token` and `state`.
 * @throws `LtiError` with the reason of the failed check: `legacy-launch`, `state-unknown`, `state-expired`,
 * `state-reused`, `state-cookie`, `origin-mismatch`, `storage-mismatch`, `platform-unknown`, `token-malformed`,

 * `version-unsupported`, `deployment-unknown`, `claim-missing` or `claim-invalid`.
 * @throws `ServiceError` when the platform's key set cannot be fetched.
 * @throws The `reason` of `options.signal` when it aborts before the login is deleted: the login stays.
